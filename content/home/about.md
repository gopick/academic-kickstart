# Biography

I am a senior undergraduate student at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](http://iitk.ac.in) majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I will continue my stay here for one more year to complete my masters in computer science.

The section below lists my academic interests, but it isn't a reliable representation of how I spend my time.
I am a 'Renaissance man'. Most of you might associate positive connotations with the phrase but that isn't entirely accurate.
Wide range of interests result in a number of unresolved ventures, divided attention and, diminished time. I have been meaning to prioritize and focus, ironically, it has been an unsuccessful campaign. But my varied interests facilitate a good conversation, so if you want to buy me a coffee, you are always welcome.
