# Biography

I have joined Goldman Sachs after my stay at IIT Kanpur. This is a platform for me to speak my mind; to curate some of my ideas and opinions.
This is a personal blog and all the views here are my own.

The section below lists my academic interests, but it isn't a reliable representation of how I spend my free time.
I am a 'Renaissance man'. Most of you might associate positive connotations with the phrase but that isn't entirely accurate.
Wide range of interests result in a number of unresolved ventures, divided attention and, diminished time.
I have been meaning to prioritize and focus but it has been an unsuccessful campaign so far.
But my varied interests facilitate a good conversation, so if you want to buy me a coffee, you are always welcome.
